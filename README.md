# virtual-closet

# description
Virtual closet provides an interactive tool to have a copy of your closet online! Functionalities of virtual closet include inserting an 
item into your closet, deleting an item in your closet, and printing all items in your closet.

# technologies used
This program was created in C++ with databases created with open-source SQLite.

# challenges
This was my first time using a database, so I had to do a lot of research on how to implement each of the features that I had planned
for the program. I think this program was a great learning opportunity for me, and I also got to make learning fun by combining two
of my passions: coding and fashion!

# future features
I would love to implement a way to upload pictures of the clothes added to virtual closet through OpenCV.
